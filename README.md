# RDS Workshop

This Github reporistory includes materials used in a 60min tutorial on statistical analysis of RDS data using the R statistical computing language. The tutorial will provide a brief introduction to statistical computing using R. We will then proceed to demonstrate key aspects involved with analyzing/reporting data collected under an RDS study design. Statistical methods will be motivated using a real (open-source) dataset from political science, focusing on the estimating the proportion of Syrians involved in political activism (pre and post 2011). Further, the tutorial will attempt to contextualize presented analyses in terms of the SROBE-RDS reporting guidelines.

# The R Project for Statistical Computing

R is a popular open source statistical computing environment. 

The comprehensive R archive network (CRAN) provides information regarding R, its history, its functionality (including tutorials on the language), as well as information on how R can be dowloaded, and extended via user-contributed packages. [https://cran.r-project.org/]

# Syrian Political Activism Dataset

The Syrian political activism dataset used in this tutorial is described in additional detail by Khoury (2020) in the research manuscript provided below.

# STROBE-RDS

STROBE was developed to strengthen/standardize the reporting of studies involving data collected under observations research designs. STROBE-RDS extends the original STROBE guidelines, to provide specific advice to researchers involved in studies where data are collected under a RDS-study design.
